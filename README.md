# PDF Reading Chatbot ðŸ§°

A project using Azure AI Foundry to create a Chatbot able to answer questions based on info extracted from PDF Files.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The aim of this project is to build an intelligent assistant capable of reading, indexing, and answering questions about the content of PDF documents â€” specifically academic papers and technical articles related to the Data field. This is especially useful for students and researchers looking to structure and correlate information across multiple sources when working on research projects such as a final undergraduate thesis.

This chatbot is intended to support the early stages of writing a Final Year Project Dissertation focused on **Data Professions and their various subfields**, such as data science, data engineering, and business intelligence.

Instead of manually reading dozens of documents, the chatbot enables contextual Q&A based on the content of the uploaded PDFs. It uses vector databases, document embeddings, and generative AI to understand and generate relevant responses grounded in your files.

## âœ… Key Features

- Upload and analyze academic or technical PDFs
- Extract and vectorize text content using embeddings
- Query information using natural language
- Retrieve context-aware answers backed by the source documents
- Simulate with `.txt` files before switching to real PDFs
